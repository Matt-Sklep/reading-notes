# Matthew's Reading Journal

My name is Matthew Sklepowich and I am currently learning various programming languages through Code Fellows. This page is meant for me to store notes as I learn new things with them. My Github portfolio page can be found [here](https://github.com/Matt-Sklep).

## Table of Contents

This is a table of contents for each module I have gone through in the Code102 course. Each page has notes on what was learned in that module.
