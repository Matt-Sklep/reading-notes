# Matthew's Reading Journal

My name is Matthew Sklepowich and I am currently learning various programming languages through Code Fellows. This page is meant for me to store notes as I learn new things with them. My Github portfolio page can be found [here](https://github.com/Matt-Sklep).

### What is the Growth Mindset?

```
The Growth mindset is a way of thinking that helps an individual succeed inside and outside of work. 
By not walking away at the sight of a problem, but instead using the challenge as a motivation, 
you're able to become more productive. Turning your frustrations into motivations creates better
habits for you and helps lift up your way of life.
```

### Reminders to Keep a Growth Mindset

- Don't walk away from a problem when you get stuck. Recognize what you're feeling from this problem, and use those feels as motivation to find the solution.
- At the end of the day, ask yourself how it went. Highlight the positives and recognizes the negatives *while coming up with solutions so they don't occur again.*
- Your peers aren't competition, but are people who you can bounce ideas off of. Using two minds is greater than one, and this will lead to all parties becoming stronger.
