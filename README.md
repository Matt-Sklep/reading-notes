# Matthew's Reading Journal

My name is Matthew Sklepowich and I am currently learning various programming languages through Code Fellows. This page is meant for me to store notes as I learn new things with them. My Github portfolio page can be found [here](https://github.com/Matt-Sklep).

### What is the Growth Mindset?

```
The Growth mindset is a way of thinking that helps an individual succeed inside and outside of work. 
By not walking away at the sight of a problem, but instead using the challenge as a motivation, 
you're able to become more productive. Turning your frustrations into motivations creates better
habits for you and helps lift up your way of life.
```

### Reminders to Keep a Growth Mindset

- Don't walk away from a problem when you get stuck. Recognize what you're feeling from this problem, and use those feelings as motivation to find the solution.
- At the end of the day, ask yourself how it went. Highlight the positives and recognizes the negatives *while coming up with solutions so they don't occur again.*
- Your peers aren't competition, but are people who you can bounce ideas off of. Using two minds is greater than one, and this will lead to all parties becoming stronger.

### Using Markdown with Github Pages

Using Markdown with Github Pages is a great way to build an impressive-looking website without any knowledge of programming languages.

#### Symbols Used for Styling
Markdown uses a small handful of symbols on a keyboard to create stylistic changes to your webpage. There are a few select symbols that drastically change the flow of your webpage from just being a screen with text.

```# Symbols```
By putting 1-6 `#` symbols (and a space) before a header, you can change the size of your headings to help visitors know where something new starts. 1 # is the biggest a header can be, and 6 # is the smallest.

```* & _ Symbols```
The asterisk and the underscore both allow you to bold and italicize your text, by placing a number of them on both sides of the text you want to emphasize. *1* of these symbols on each side italicizes, **2** will bold, and ***3*** will italicize and bold.

```Making Lists```
Lists are incredibly easy to make. All one needs to do to start one is by starting at the number 1, adding a period and a space, and then adding the first item in the list. After that Markdown will automatically add entries every time you press enter. 
1. It's
2. Very
3. Simple!

Unordered lists are very similar, though to start them you use the `-, *, or +` sign with a space before each item.
- Just
- Like
- This!

You can also add images, easily display code, and link to other webpages using Markdown!

#### Using GitHub Pages to start a Webpage
GitHub Pages is a tool that easily allows you to create your own website, again with no programming knowledge! Simply create a GitHub account, create a new, public Repository, and by traversing to the `Settings` menu at the top right of the page, then going to the `Pages` tab, you can launch your webpage to the public. GitHub Pages gives you many different themes to help make your website more appealing too!
