## CSS Styling

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language that allows you to change the appearance of your website. It can change the style of text, add colors, create a reactive website that adjusts to a changing browser size, among things.

### Proper CSS Syntax

Writing CSS is quite a bit different from HTML, with a typical CSS element resembling:
`h1 { color: red; font-size: 2em;}`

This element opens with a *selector*, which will change every HTML element of the chosen type. In this case, we will change every `h1` element. Within the braces are declarations. Multiple declarations can be given to a single element, via delcaring a *property* and assigning it a *value*. `color` is the property, and `red` is the value. Each declaration must be closed by a semi-colon.
